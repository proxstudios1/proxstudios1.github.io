  <h1>About Pro X Studios</h1>

  <p>
    Pro X Studios is a Rajasthan-based independent music studio led by two brothers —
    <strong>1 Liner × Rajkamal Jangir</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rooted deeply in Rajasthani culture, Pro X Studios blends traditional Indian folk,
    Hindi, Punjabi, and regional sounds with modern global genres such as hip-hop,
    cinematic music, experimental electronic, and contemporary world music.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond music creation, Pro X Studios also delivers professional-grade
    <strong>mixing and mastering</strong>, ensuring every track meets international
    loudness, clarity, and sonic balance standards. Each song is crafted with precision —
    from raw idea to final polished master.
  </p>

  <p>
    The studio is known for creating music that respects tradition but refuses limitation.
    Every composition is built on original lyrics, cultural depth, clean sound design,
    and modern production aesthetics — delivering a sound that feels raw, powerful,
    and globally relevant.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Pro X Studios, music is not confined to one language or genre.
    It is a fusion of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Indian traditional emotions</li>
    <li>Modern storytelling</li>
    <li>Cinematic sound design</li>
    <li>Professional mixing & mastering</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is simple:<br>
    <strong>Create something new, honest, and timeless — music that speaks beyond borders.</strong>

  <h2>🎧 Philosophy</h2>

  <p><em>“Rooted in Rajasthan. Designed for the world.”</em></p>

  <p>
    We believe tradition is not something to preserve behind glass —
    it is something to carry forward with courage, technology, and innovation.
